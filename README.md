# cellular-automata
An implementation of 2D cellular automata in Python to be used as a part of a project for a class I am taking in dynamical systems. The second part of my project will be to implement 1D cellulator automata for the purpose of cryptography. This will be in a second repository, which I will link here when it is finished.
